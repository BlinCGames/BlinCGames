# I. Executive Summary

BlinC Games Inc. is a Delaware C Corp founded Oct 2019. BlinC is an app that allows players to find and organize any type of game, anywhere, any time and pays them for organizing, winning or referring others to our platform. If you can play it, you can BlinC it.

BlinC combines all the fundamental parts of a competitive gaming event into one platform: Players, Organizers, Athletes, Influencers, Venues, Officials, Trainers, Coaches, Fans and more are connected using a simple interface that allows Players to find the right people and the right place to organize a tournament, invite other players, and distributes winnings to the champions.

When we started BlinC, there were no good solutions to consistently find games for sports, let alone board games and other smaller communities that don’t have their own platform to organize on. Pick-up games? Hope there are people at the park when I drive by. Organize a tournament? Call 4-5 venues, get their rates, lock down a rental, and then work on hiring ref’s, coaches and trainers. Payments split between cash, expensive card readers, and IOU’s that may or may not be paid in the future. Doing all of this takes valuable time, and takes away from being able to recruit the players you need to make your tournament or league a success.

By handling all payments to and from the various parties, we become the nexus point for the best, easiest gaming experience anywhere in the world. By offering organizers the opportunity to charge organizer fees for any tournament they create, we encourage hosting tournaments or leagues by becoming professional hosts, the Master of Games. While connecting the gaming community globally on one platform is our goal, our mission is to connect players to organizers, venues and other partners at the local level.

BlinC is a team made up of passionate professionals with diverse backgrounds. We have a balanced team that is dedicated to working hard, competing, creating solutions, and providing excellent service to each other and our partners. Our current team covers development, customer support, data, partnerships, branding and marketing. It will be critical as a growing company to add the right pieces to the team and our focus on

building culture starts with the people we recruit and interview from day one all the way to our 1000th associate.

After pivoting from live games to focusing on e-sports due to Covid, we have created a dynamic app that allows players to quickly organize an esports tournament, share it with their friends, and distribute winnings to champions with a few seamless steps. We can solidify our foundation by leveraging our partnerships with professional athletes, like former NFL player Frostee Rucker, and streamers who can introduce us to their large fan bases. Frostee and other players will introduce us to the unions and leagues they play in to become official sponsors of the NFL, NBA, etc., while we work with charities and other youth-focused organizations that we can have an impact with. However, participation in our Royalty Network by the players, organizers and venues that use our platform is the critical piece and our biggest driver of users to the platform. This network creates an ecosystem where everyone is able to earn money for their referrals over a 10 year period.

# II. BlinC Description

# 1\. BlinC mission statement

BlinC is the LinC between players and the games they love. By providing a unique, free platform for all aspects of the gaming world, we aim to give the best experience for players, venues, organizers and all other participants in the gaming ecosystem through BlinC.

# 2\. BlinC philosophy and vision

1. Our values are to be Connective, Competitive, Charitable, Consistent and Compassionate.

2. We are a privately held company owned by the Public. We will be a Minority-Majority enterprise both on our cap table, in the boardroom and with our associates.

3. Our vision is to become the biggest platform for games in the world and to connect, directly or indirectly, as many humans as possible by increasing access to games through BlinC.

4. BlinC aims to use our modern screens to connect players both in person and online.

5. Sports and Games are elemental to our society with the lessons they teach, the relationships they foster and the competition they create. We aim to reverse trends with groups such as the youth, girls and low income families to ensure the barriers are lowered for anyone who wants to find a fun, safe, competitive game.

6. It is a sacred responsibility to host games and be the arbiter of justice for these games. We serve at the pleasure of our partners and work with local communities, organizers, government and NGO partners that share our desire to connect all humans through games. To ensure this vision is fulfilled, we will put significant resources, time and most crucially our best people towards serving our partners anywhere, anytime.


# 3\. BlinC goals

a. To build connections globally through sports and games.

b. To integrate our platform into all aspects of gaming, from youth sports to retirees. Competitive leagues, tournaments, camps and pickup games and more will be organized on BlinC.

c. To actively use sports and games as a means of connecting humans on a global scale through their local communities.

d. To democratize sports and games.

e. To create a Royalty Network that pays all partners on the app for any referral they bring onto the platform.

f. To own property upon which to build or expand BlinC Centers with local partners.

g. To own professional sports and esports teams, with a focus on women’s sports and leagues.

h. To use our platform to promote charitable causes, youth sports & education, and peacefully compete with ourselves & each other in a healthy, connective way.

. To pay our fair share in taxes due to the large amount of revenue we generate and to affect tax policy positively for ourselves, our communities and the economy.

# 4\. Target market:

Our market is anyone that plays games of any kind, live or online. We will create a high-quality service in exponentially growing markets that can connect a massive amount of people globally that doesn't exist currently.

Pre-Covid, targeting adult recreational leagues that were already organized would have been critical to sustainable growth. These leagues typically cost $$ 300+$ per team to join and have referees, stat-keepers and other participants that are paid for by the teams. This market was aimed to be our key revenue driver for our first $^ { 2 + }$ years, as these leagues are played $3 +$ times a year and consistently attract the highest quality players and the players most likely to spend money for a better playing experience.

Pre-Covid esports and gaming had accelerated growth with mainstream adoption and support of influencers, entertainers, athletes.

“The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018, per Deloitte. That's reflected in the total dollars invested, too: Investments are up to $$ 4.5$ billion in 2018 from just $$ 490$ million the year before, a staggering YoY growth rate of $83 %$ , per Deloitte. These investments are distributed to players across the ecosystem — from esports organizations, to tournament operators, to digital broadcasters — allowing it to function and grow.” -Deloitte

In 2018 Netflix had 51 billion hours watch time on their platform. The amount of gaming watched on YouTube in 2018 was 50 billion. Esports streaming on Youtube had more hours watched than Netflix in 2019, then doubled to 100 billion by 2020. Post-Covid, the market has sky-rocketed.

Money flows into sports and esports through 5 main sources:

Media rights, which are delivered to companies by professional leagues and are distributed around the world.

Live event ticket sales, which can be handled quickly and securely on BlinC while adding a better experience than other competitors.

Merchandise sales can also be bought and sold in our store, which will handle all types of gaming merchandise, equipment and more.

In-game purchases, including skins, chests and other forms of in-game currency, will be able to be bought, sold and traded on a secure open market that is simple to navigate and use.

Sponsorships and advertising provide most of the revenue $(6 9 % )$ , per Newzoo figures cited by Statista. We will generate large sponsorships for national and international tournaments, while simultaneously connecting small and local organizers to sponsor events both local and national. When players join a sponsored tournament, they can either choose to skip the sponsor or, if they watch the video/sponsor offer, money will be deposited into the prize pot that the players are competing for. Players that sign up for our “MVP” subscription will automatically bypass sponsors.

# 5\. Industry:

There are 2.5 Billion athletes worldwide. Sports alone is a 1.3 trillion dollar market. Board games sales have grown by $20 %$ yearly in America for the past decade as people look to connect in person in fun, positive environments. Video games have expanded from their hardcore base to a fully fledged esports world that includes professional leagues, hundreds of millions in tournament prize purses and billions of fans worldwide, and there are currently 3 billion gamers with Microsoft recently saying they expect this market to grow to 4.5 billion by 2030.

This is about as big an opportunity as currently exists: To connect the entire gaming world together through one platform, to form one global community and to monetize it in a way that ensures all participants are able to generate value for themselves and other partners in the BlinC ecosystem.

While we are aware of the hyperbole that naturally comes with the creation of new technology, it feels safe to say that the problems we are aiming to solve are both massive in nature and potentially lucrative to the highest degree. We saw problems that affected a large quantity of humans and have created quality solutions that can conveniently solve them.

BlinC has the same opportunity to join those behemoths of Tech, and to make an everlasting positive effect on society at the same time.

# III. BlinC Products & Services

# 1\. BlinC services:

1. A platform for users to find and organize games, shared by players, organizers, venues and sponsors is the core function of the app.

2. The ability to organize tournaments and leagues on our platform in a matter of minutes. This can be used for competitive gaming, free pickup games, professional and semi-professional leagues, charity events, camps, youth leagues and more.

3. With BlinC, it will be easy to hire officials, referees, stat-keepers, photographers, security, and even the players themselves to create the most comprehensive, professional gaming event anywhere. This marketplace of participants creates the ability to match people who need these officials with the officials themselves, something few other platforms offer.

4. We will have an online shop where users can purchase equipment, apparel, tickets and more. This shop will have orders fulfilled by local businesses if possible, with any order that we are unable to source locally we direct to a big box store or Amazon.

5. BlinC connects influencers, content creators and athletes to their fans that allows an unique opportunity for sponsors to promote tournaments organized and hosted by their partner influencers. This allows influencers to make money on the front and backend of every promotion, while giving sponsors excellent contact with their desired customers.

6. Creating a special notification system that allows players to change their preferences to fit their schedule. No matter where they go, players can find a game with live updates being produced by the participants. Instead of being bombarded with notifications before finally turning them off entirely, we will specialize when and for how long partners receive notifications for the games, tournaments and commerce organized on BlinC.


# 2\. The problem BlinC solves:

Finding a game, anywhere, anytime. The convenience of being able to find the right group of players at a competition level the player desires. The ability to pay to join a game, league or tournament etc and to be paid out any potential winnings or fees.

Gamers often go unpaid for months after winning prizes in tournaments. With BlinC, payouts occur every Friday, or when the user requests it. We will eventually have the option of being processed instantly. This allows gamers to pay rent and focus on their craft and provides security to the blossoming online gaming ecosystem. This is also similar to how Uber made robberies or people ditching the cab a thing of the past with everyone knowing the money is online and erasing the fear of losing out on a fare.

BlinC also connects influencers, content creators and athletes to their fans that allows a unique opportunity for sponsors to promote tournaments organized and hosted by their partner influencers. This allows influencers to make money on the front and backend of every promotion, while giving sponsors excellent contact with their desired customers.

To the scale and scope of BlinC, nothing currently exists that does this for all games. There is no unified platform where users can find any type of game, organize or pay for tournaments to play in for both live and online games.

Organizing real life games, in particular, is a massive problem in America. Up to $70 %$ of active amateur athletes are unable to find games at least once a month because they can’t find enough players. Further, $7 4 . 3 %$ of non-active Americans say they aren't physically active because they don't have people to play with. Those numbers are astounding.

This problem expands exponentially when trying to organize leagues or tournaments, especially in person. Starting from scratch, you have to search and then contact multiple venues to find out if their space is available. Once you have paid over the phone or shown up to put down a deposit, you may need to hire officials, trainers or perhaps a photographer. Some referee unions don't allow their members to be hired without being contacted first, introducing new headaches. This process can take hours at a minimum, and often days or even weeks.

In a matter of moments, any player with no previous knowledge can organize a professional-level tournament or league after being guided through BlinC’s platform.

On a more elemental level, a recent study project over half of America's youth to become obese by the time they turn 35. That is both scary and a massive cost to our society, and something we hope to help solve with solutions like our Sandlot Mode to make sports local again in the age of the 15.3 billion dollar youth professional sports industry. COVID-related deaths have been undeniably linked to obesity and the future health crisis of America is an unhealthy population.

# 3\. Pricing:

1. $5 %$ of all fees for all transactions will be directly debited to us, monetizing from the moment we launch BlinC.

2. A premium subscription model for players, organizers, venues and sponsors that provides various services for organizing and promoting events.

3. Sponsorships within the app will provide another stream of revenue while also connecting our strategic partners directly to their consumers.

4. Partners will have the choice to sell their data directly to companies or completely opt out of sharing any data.

5. A store with rewards, merchandise, equipment, tickets, jerseys, skins and other items partners put there.


# IV. Marketing and Promotional Plan

For our initial beta testing, we will seed tournaments with small amounts of money to test the app, get our first adopters, and gather data on our first adopters while players have a chance to win money. This is similar to the strategy that Fanduel and Draftkings used when they initially launched.

Called “freerolls”, these free to join tournaments allow players to test out the platform and compete with each other without having to commit any money of their own. We also are able to leverage these new players and champions by having them post that they won on their own social media platform, allowing for others to see their success and sign up with their friends' royalty link.

The tournaments will be given prize money as follows:

8-12 players - $$ 10$ . Running 80 tournaments, it would cost $$ 800$ and net us an estimated

640 players.

13-24 players - $$ 25$ . Running 50 tournaments, it would cost $$ 1,250$ and net us an estimated 1000 players.

25-40 players - $$ 50$ . Running 50 tournaments, it would cost $$ 2,500$ and net us an estimated 1,500 players.

41-150 players - $$ 75-200$ . Running 20 tournaments at $$ 100$ per tournament, it would cost us $$ 2,000$ and net us an estimated 1,500 players.

3 large special tournaments with $$ 500 – $ 1000$ as a prize will be organized with our largest influencers. This would net us an estimated 2,000 players. This entire campaign would cost just below $$ 10,000$ and would net us an estimated ${ \\bf 6 , 0 0 0 + }$ players. Obviously there would be repeat players, but the goal would be to add as many new users as possible and then turn them into repeat competitors.

We plan to focus our promotions to paying players for winning tournaments on BlinC and MOG’s to run them. This initial budget will be for $$ 100,000$ for our initial launch phase, with an increasing amount going to this budget as we scale.

Partnering with organizers, athletes, streamers and other influencers is key to expanding the overall user base. By focusing our efforts on these key strategic partners, we can leverage their existing networks and generate organic, exponential growth without expending actual capital to the marketing of the app outside of the service we provide the influencer, our main use of capital will be providing cash prizes for tournaments these partners throw.

Organizers can apply to receive free prize money for their tournaments, which we will send directly to their tournament champions. This is subject to time limits and other requirements we have, but this encourages organizers to bring their network onto BlinC for free and to sign them up under their own Royalty network, which is how they will get paid long term.

Our long term strategy is to focus on leveraging organic exponential growth with athletes, influencers, entertainers, and streamers as our partners in bringing players to the app. We plan on relying on a Royalty Network where partners are rewarded with up to a $5 %$ royalty on every transaction their direct or indirect referrals spend or make on BlinC for the next 10 years.

This has multiple benefits, starting with the relationship being created between the initial partner & their players they sign up. Instead of paying people directly out of pocket, we spend nothing up front and the cash is earned through the use of our platform. This ensures that people are motivated to help organize games, tournaments and other events or encourage players to play more games and tournaments. This money is paid out every quarter over a 10 year period with no cap for the amount of referrals made.

This creates an ecosystem where players are interconnected with their local gaming community, influencers and sponsors are able to connect directly with fans, and builds out our database organically, all while costing us nothing in terms of up-front expenditure while still paying people for their efforts in expanding the community.

# Location for Beta

Esports allows for us to test BlinC with partners across the country and with various levels of skill, knowledge of the platform and without ties to us. We pivoted from real life games to this focus online because of Covid, but this opened up our beta to a far bigger market to test with and gather data from. Our real life tournaments will be conducted in Santa Barbara and in Santa Rosa, CA. Our first venues for sports will be the Page Youth Center, the Westside Boys and Girls Club and the Rohnert Park Recreational Gym. For esports, we will utilize the Backstage at the Red Piano in Santa Barbara.

# V. Operational Plan

# 1\. Production

Moody Hasheem and Amir Ismael and their development team at Genwin are our developing partners. As we raise capital, we will add a full time CTO and other developers to build out the product in house.

# 2\. Quality control

The developers will test quality at every step in the process, and Amir will maintain this quality after the app is delivered along with other developers we plan to hire with capital raised.

# 3\. Location

California

# 4\. Legal environment

a. Skills-based gaming is legal for all $1 8 +$ adults. While we are not a gambling app, ensuring we are on the right side of gaming and gambling laws is paramount to our short and mid-term success. Long term, regulations may change that allow us to explore other avenues in the esports betting markets.

b. We have a trademark pending for BlinC and will be applying for more with further funding.

c. $1 8 +$ only for our user base due to money being exchanged over the app.

# 5\. Personnel

d. Talented Individuals with high levels of integrity, work ethic, intelligence, compassion and a sense of humor.

e. Less than 10 including a CTO, CMO, CFO, developers, and a customer success team that sign up venues and work with a world class partner support team to ensure current users have issues resolved quickly and effectively.

f. We will have partners called Master of Games who refer large numbers of players, organizers and venues to BlinC. They get paid royalties on the partners they refer, like all partners, but they have special privileges that allow them to organize exclusive tournaments, verify results or stats, and have access to other tools to help them create special experiences for users on BlinC. We will hire the best MOG’s based on their numbers and then interviews we conduct with them.

g. Commission from the Royalty Network for MOG’s, salary & equity options for Associates.

h. Personal networks and referrals will be the base of our associate foundation at BlinC. We are a unique company with a culture based on respect, openness and willingness to laugh at ourselves and one another with radical honesty and accountability. For the first $5 0 +$ associates (at minimum) we plan to hire based on referrals.

i. The ability to be radically transparent, accountable to constructive criticism with the rest of the team is critical to our success. Culture training will be as important as job training, as we will all be learning on the job and which

skillsets are needed to do the job right but the culture is paramount to our short and long term success.

# 2\. Gaps

I am a strong believer in getting people with talent, drive and integrity and allowing them to grow into the roles we give them.

We need to fill out the executive team by the middle of 2022, with marketing, financing, accounting, sales, data management, recruiters, developers and more being added one at a time to fill specific roles, with an overall desire to hire people who reflect our passions and desire to build a special company for the gaming world.

The main addition for scale will be Masters of Games, local associates that organize games, visit the venues and provide support for the local area's gaming community. Venue relationships are of particular importance for these Masters of Games, and they are the ambassadors for not only our brand but for the gaming community in their regions.

The MOG’s are our link to the world, and we will hire them based on how many users and venues they sign up. That scale will be a natural part of our growth, as the more places BlinC is brought to, the bigger the opportunity there is for anyone to take advantage of our generous marketing promotions.
